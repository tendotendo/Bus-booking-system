# bus booking system
This system i created for it to aid passengers to book bus seats to their destination at fixed depature times. It also aids the owner to arrange the bus schedules and know 
their income. The system can also print tickets for passengers.
The passengers can book specific seats based on their best suite.
one can also book as many tickets as he could.
All the buses can show the number pf seats available for passengers to book.
This system ensures a secure login by using a specific username and password as set by the user.
My system curently has five different buses to diffferent destinations.
This system can be ran using any c software like Falcon C++, Code blocks, Dev C++ and many more.
This system is user friendly and can be used by anyone.
